	<h1>Peeta Mellark</h1>
	<img src="img/peetamellark.jpg" />
	<p>With the plethora of bad boys with soft mushy hearts these days, Peeta Mellark's nice guy character is both somewhat traditional, but refreshing. Though characterized as weak by many, Peeta's main strength comes from his capability of selfless love as well as his ability to show it. He's not tough or 'manly' according to societal standards, but he has an emotional stability and a need to maintain his inner self that makes him arguable stronger than any of the other contestants. He stands amongst other dark and twisty characters as a believable, beam of light that struggles to remain bright. More than that, he is a reminder that morals, ethics, love and empathy are what make a person remarkable. And he's absolutely adorable.</p>
	<p>He is one of the main characters of Suzanne Collins' prized series <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games">The Hunger Games</a>. Due to the odds not being in his favor, Peeta is selected to participate in the sacrificial Hunger Games along with a semi-voluntary Katniss Everdeen. Together they struggle for survival in morbid and brutual competition with various people from other districts. Read the books! The movies are pretty great too :)!!</p>
